Project topic: Movie Search & Filter Dashboard

Project Description: For our project we would like to build a front-end dashboard that would allow a user to search and filter movie data through various filters.
By selecting filters (i.e. provided in a drop-down menu) the dashboard will automatically create visualizations such as:
- showing the average ratings of movies within a genre over a specified period of time (line graph)
- plotting where movies were filmed on a map using Leaflet
- searching for actor stats such as actors in the most movies, actors in the most movies that have won awards, actors with the longest careers - this could be done with D3 to account for multiple axis options
For our data sources we plan to use OMDb API and/or scraping Rotten Tomatoes
